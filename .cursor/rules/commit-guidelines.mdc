# Commit Guidelines and Quality Checks

## Pre-Commit Requirements

**CRITICAL: Before creating any commit, you MUST ensure the project passes all quality checks:**

### 1. Linting Check
```bash
pnpm lint
```
- Must pass without errors
- Fix any linting issues before committing
- Use `pnpm lint:fix` to automatically fix issues when possible

### 2. Type Checking
```bash
pnpm type-check
```
- All TypeScript types must be valid across all packages
- Fix any type errors before committing
- Ensure no `any` types are introduced without justification

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
pnpm build
```
- All packages must build successfully
- Fix any build errors before committing
- Ensure no breaking changes to build process

### 4. Test Execution
```bash
pnpm test:unit
```
- All unit tests must pass
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update tests for modified functionality

### 5. Format Verification
```bash
pnpm format:check
```
- Code must be properly formatted
- Use `pnpm format` to fix formatting issues
- Ensure consistent code style across the project

## Commit Workflow

1. **Make your changes**
2. **Run quality checks in order:**
   ```bash
   # Check formatting first (fastest)
   pnpm format:check || pnpm format
   
   # Run linting
   pnpm lint
   
   # Verify types
   pnpm type-check
   
   # Run tests
   pnpm test:unit
   
   # Verify build
   pnpm build
   ```
3. **Only commit if ALL checks pass**
4. **Write descriptive commit messages**

## Quality Check Commands

### Quick Check (recommended before commit)
```bash
# Run all essential checks
pnpm lint && pnpm type-check && pnpm test:unit && pnpm build
```

### Format and Fix
```bash
# Auto-fix formatting and linting issues
pnpm format && pnpm lint:fix
```

## Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation changes
- style: formatting changes
- refactor: code refactoring
- test: adding tests
- chore: maintenance tasks
```

## Emergency Situations

If you absolutely must commit without passing all checks (emergency hotfix):
1. Document why in the commit message
2. Create a follow-up issue to fix the quality issues
3. Fix the issues in the next commit

## Integration with Development Tools

- **Cursor AI**: Always run these checks before suggesting commits
- **Pre-push Hook**: The project has a pre-push hook that will catch issues, but local checking is faster
- **CI/CD**: These same checks run in CI, so passing them locally prevents CI failures

## Performance Tips

- Run `pnpm format:check` first (fastest check)
- Use `pnpm lint:fix` to auto-fix many linting issues
- Keep dependencies up to date to avoid build issues
- Run tests frequently during development to catch issues early

Remember: **Quality code is committed code. Never commit broken code.**
